# Face-recognition (Ongoing)

• Fine tuned a pre-trained vggface vgg16 model for identifying persons in images and videos using data-sets created
for personal use
• Extracted faces from input using OpenCV and haarcascade to be used for identifying the people in them
• Utilized OpenCV to create a program to convert videos to folders of images to be utilized further for sorting videos
• Takes an input of a photo/video or a folder of the two and identifies the person in the picture
